Piblin
=================================================================

The `piblin <https://github.com/3mcloud/piblin>`_ is a Python package developed at `3M <https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/about-3m/research-development/>`_
designed to  provide a conceptual framework and implementation of functionality enabling measurement data
science. The package reads analytical data files, organizes analytical data into a hierarchy of experiments, provides
common transformations and a pipeline concept for processing analytical data, and allows visualization of analytical
data. The package is easily extensible to unsupported analytical techniques.


Check out the :doc:`quickstart` section for more information on getting started.
