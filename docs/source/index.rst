Piblin
=================================================================


The piblin package provides a conceptual framework and implementation of functionality enabling measurement data
science. The package reads analytical data files, organizes analytical data into a hierarchy of experiments, provides
common transformations and a pipeline concept for processing analytical data, and allows visualization of analytical
data. The package is easily extensible to unsupported analytical techniques.
